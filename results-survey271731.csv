Dafür wäre es sinnvoll ein Accountsystem einzuführen, indem Personen ihren Fortschritt speichern können und dadurch täglich durch das Spiel Dinge erledigen und journalig etc betreiben.

Ich nehme außerdem an das im Hintergrund wahrscheinlich Auswertungen über Lesezeit, Schnelles oder langsames durchklicken von Dialogfeldern, geschriebene Wörter und ausgewählte Optionen eine gewisse Entscheidung getroffen wird wie es der Person die dieses Spiel spielt geht. Wenn es so wäre kann man das natürlich auch gut benutzen um Mentale Krankheiten zu diagnostizieren und Menschen Hilfe anzubieten. Viel Potenzial auf jeden Fall. ","Die Textfelder scrollen nicht automatisch nach oben. Es ist nirgendwo angegeben wie man nach einem generierten Text zum nächsten Dialogschritt kommt, man muss herausfinden das es durch mausklicken funktioniert. Es werden Bars erklärt die noch garnicht auf dem screen sind. Es ist nicht erklärt wir man zu den Tasks kommt, man muss den kleinen schwarzen punkt in der Ecke sehen (icon mit buch etwas größer wäre gut)","Yes"

- Fan of the gameplay (interactive visual novel)
- The idea of the 4 status bars was really nice
- Short game but very sweet and concise.

For instance, choosing to go to work or doing difficult uni tasks, having a difficult conversation with loved ones, just having a depressing day, etc.


","I enjoyed the game. The topic resonates with me a lot, so I was very interested in playing the game. It is very important to adress this type of heavy theme and the author has done a really good job in doing so, simultaneously she gave the player some advice to take care of themselves. Well done!:)","No"
