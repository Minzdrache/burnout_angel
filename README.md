# game_programming

This repo saves my efforts for the class game programming of semester 7 of my artificial intelligence bachelor.
The game engine is Godot!


progress:
* 13.12.2024: initialized git for this project 
* 14.12.2024: 
    fixed "start game" button to activate the timeline "000triggers"
    dialouge for stat introduction in "002first_day"
    added scene calendartest with containers for a weekly planning 
* 15.12.2024: 
    worked on calendar management items: 
    added small and big boxes in 2 scenes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNvzGKCkNXg&t=447s
    (when the correct small box is put into the correct big box, the big box changes color )
    user can drag small boxes
* 28.12.2024:
    saved background images
* 02.01.2025: 
    Drag and Drop works from one source_container to one target_container
    added main_menu https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHYkcJyE52g more good stuff on: https://cococode.net/godot
    added font for title
    made first visual progress bar
* 03.01.2025:
    progress bars are visible in calender scene
    progress bars get updated (I think)
    calendar choosing activities from source to target_container works, updates stats
* 04.01.2025:
    real character picture, changes mood in Dialogic for Lory
    nice start menu, start game leads to first dialouge
    pause game implemented with pause_manager (must be in every scene)
    menu in game with current day, level and experience
    hovering over progress bars shows their name
    dragging a calendar activity shows its stat changes
    "start day" button in calender scene -> loads next scene 
    progress bars get updated every frame
    doctor visit 1 as scene and timeline, scene has button "go home" that loads the next activity
* 05.01.2025: 
    status bars update themselves
    journal minigame (in progress), fixed: progress bars update as result of finishing journal minigame
    connect scenes to get fully playable game, minor fix: connected main_menu with bedroom and bedroom with timelines
    made font equal everywhere (except the source and target container of calendar, except the dialouge (maybe find a better font for dialouges)...)
* 06.01.2025:
    minor fixes in dialouges
     fixed bug: nach Main_menu kommt man auf bedroom, von hier aus startet dann 001triggers timeline,
     nach 002first_day kommt man zur체ck ins bedroom, klickt "next_activity" und kommt zum Kalender (1. Aktivit채t l채uft an), es l채uft alles gut bis man wieder im Bedroom ist und auf "next_activity" klickt, dann startet 001triggers erneut...
     fix used: made started_timelines a global variable (instead of a local var in bedroom (this resets every time the scene is left!))
    fixed bug: in game when journal comes, every letter gets a seperate line... like:
      I  
      a
      m
    fixed bug: journal entry in "You finished your first game" is "placeholder..." (only appears in full game)
todo:
    bug: activity_doctor, activity_walk has local variable that should be public "counter"
    bug: doctor choice looks odd
    after mindfullness I can't go on to the journaling
    when you reach the end and want to play again, reset_ all variables in stats_manager and activities_manager
    test getting bars below 0
    test dialouges without backgrounds ( so the stat bars show...)
    

todo:
    fix font in source and target container of calendar
    picture with facial expressions for angel (not yet implemented)
    get sounds to all dialouge scenes
    make screenshots of bedroom_bars scene and make them as background in timeline 002first_day
   

    additional character ideas: 
        angel? change colors and add wings https://noranekogames.itch.io/chie-free-character-sprite
